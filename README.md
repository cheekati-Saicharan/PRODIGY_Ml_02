PRODIGY_DS_02_CustomerClustering
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to segment retail store customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing features such as annual income and spending score, we identify distinct customer groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved business insights. This is the second task for the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship.

1. Problem Statement
In the competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behavior is paramount for effective marketing and business strategy. Retail stores often collect vast amounts of transactional data, but without proper analysis, this data remains underutilized. The challenge is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing habits (represented by annual income and spending score) to enable targeted marketing campaigns, personalized recommendations, and improved customer relationship management.

Objective: To apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment retail store customers, allowing the business to gain insights into different customer archetypes and develop tailored strategies for each segment.

2. Dataset
The project utilizes the Mall Customers Segmentation Dataset, available on Kaggle.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Dataset Description:

The dataset typically includes the following columns:

Column Name

Description

CustomerID

Unique ID for each customer.

Gender

Male or Female.

Age

Age of the customer.

Annual Income (k$)

Customer's annual income (in thousands of USD).

Spending Score (1-100)

A score assigned by the mall (1â€“100) based on behavior.

For this project, Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) are the primary features used for clustering.

3. Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, specifically K-Means clustering and StandardScaler.

4. Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

Data Loading: The Mall_Customers.csv dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Error handling is included to ensure the dataset is found.

Initial Data Exploration: Basic checks like df.head(), df.info(), df.isnull().sum(), df.shape, and df.describe() are performed to understand the dataset's structure, types, and summary statistics.

Feature Selection: The relevant features, Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100), are selected for clustering.

Feature Scaling: StandardScaler is applied to normalize the selected features. This is crucial for K-Means, as it relies on distance calculations, and unscaled features can lead to biased results.

Elbow Method for Optimal K: The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). This involves calculating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for a range of K values (1 to 10) and plotting the results. The "elbow" point in the plot indicates the value of K where the decrease in WCSS begins to slow down significantly. For this dataset, K=5 is typically identified as the optimal number.

K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied with the chosen optimal K=5. Each customer is assigned a cluster label.

Visualization: A scatter plot is generated, displaying customers based on their annual income and spending score, with points colored according to their assigned cluster. This provides a clear visual representation of the segmented customer groups.

Cluster Analysis and Interpretation: The mean values of Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100), Age, and Gender are calculated for each cluster. These statistics are used to interpret the unique characteristics and behaviors of each customer segment, leading to actionable business insights.

5. Results & Visuals
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully segments the customers into 5 distinct groups.

Elbow Method Plot:

This plot demonstrates the rationale behind choosing K=5, as the decrease in WCSS becomes less pronounced after this point.

Customer Segments Scatter Plot:

This visualization clearly separates customers into visually distinct groups based on their income and spending habits.

6. Interpretation of Customer Segments
Based on the analysis of annual income and spending score, customers are segmented into the following distinct groups:

Cluster X: High Income, High Spenders (VIP Customers)

Characteristics: Customers with significantly high annual income and equally high spending scores.

Rationale/Targeting: This is your most valuable segment. Focus on premium product offerings, exclusive loyalty programs, personalized luxury experiences, and retention strategies.

Cluster Y: High Income, Low Spenders (Careful Spenders)

Characteristics: Customers with high annual income but relatively low spending scores.

Rationale/Targeting: These customers have purchasing power but are not utilizing it much at the mall. Strategies could involve enticing them with unique propositions, highlighting value, or understanding their unmet needs.

Cluster Z: Low Income, High Spenders (Impulsive/Value Seekers)

Characteristics: Customers with lower annual income but remarkably high spending scores.

Rationale/Targeting: This group might be highly sensitive to promotions, discounts, or impulse purchases. Focus on value-for-money products, sales events, and essential product promotions.

Cluster A: Low Income, Low Spenders (Budget-Conscious)

Characteristics: Customers with both low annual income and low spending scores.

Rationale/Targeting: This segment is highly budget-conscious. Marketing strategies should focus on essential goods, clearance sales, and affordable options.

Cluster B: Average Income, Average Spenders (General Customer Base)

Characteristics: Customers who fall in the middle range for both income and spending.

Rationale/Targeting: This represents a significant portion of your customer base. They can be targeted with a broad range of products and general promotions. Understanding their specific preferences within this large group can lead to further sub-segmentation if needed.

(Note: Replace X, Y, Z, A, B with the actual cluster numbers from your output as they can vary slightly with each run if random_state wasn't fixed for the final KMeans model, or if the interpretation mapping needs adjustment based on your specific cluster_summary table.)
